How It Works
This tool helps users upload a PDF and get a short summary of its content.
When a user uploads a PDF file through the Streamlit interface, the app reads
and extracts all the text from the file using a library called PyMuPDF. If the text is
too long, it breaks it into smaller parts so that the summarization model can
handle it easily.
Each part is then sent to a pre-trained AI model (like BART or T5 from Hugging
Face) that reads the text and creates a short summary. After all parts are
summarized, the app combines them into one final summary and shows it to the
user. This way, users can quickly understand long PDFs without reading the
whole thing.
